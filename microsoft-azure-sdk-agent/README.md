# Microsoft Azure SDK Agent (Later)

This area is a placeholder for Azure Agent Framework examples in Python.

## How this fits

- Roadmap: `docs/00-roadmap.md`
- Cross-framework parity: `docs/02-workflows.md`

## Status

- Placeholder only
- Planned for a later phase after Google ADK foundations

## Planned parity

Examples here will mirror orchestration patterns from:

- `orchestration/`
- `langgraph-examples/`
- `crewai-examples/`
